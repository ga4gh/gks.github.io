Categorical Variation Representation Specification (Cat-VRS)A standard for describing sets of related genetic variants in a way that computers can understand, compare, and use. Instead of focusing on individual mutations, Cat-VRS helps researchers, clinicians, and knowledgebases define broader categories \u2014 like oncogenic KRAS mutations or loss-of-function variants in BRCA1 \u2014 using precise, modular building blocks called constraints.\u2022 Documentation\u2022 GitHub: cat-vrs reference implementation\u2022 Get Involved! Variant Annotation (VA)Annotations of genomic variants may assert knowledge about a variant's molecular consequence, impact on gene function, population frequency, pathogenicity, or impact on therapeutic response. These statements add to our shared understanding of the impact of certain genetic variants on human health and disease.\u2022 Documentation\u2022 GitHub: va-spec reference implementation\u2022 Get Involved! Sequence Annotation (SA)Researchers use sequence annotation to document detailed information about specific features on a DNA sequence. The SA specification aims to define an extensible, common model for describing specific genomic regions of interest.\u2022 Get Involved!"},{"location":"#community","title":"Community","text":"<p>The GKS Work Stream is an open, collaborative effort driven by international experts in genomics, informatics, and clinical care.
